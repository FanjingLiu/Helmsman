    <h1>Hey there</h1>
    <p>
        I am glad you are here. This is 刘凡竞, aka, Frank, aka, thetank, aka, lil Albert ,aka, lil Issac, aka, lil Nikola, aka, leetcode global ranking 868th.
        <br>
        I've decided to go down this path of building a personal/hobby site while I wait for my work authorization.
        
        <br>
         I have became so bored that I started doing cardio and learning shit. hopefully I can think of some cool and unique project to flex on all yall.
        <br>
        I don't know where this is going yet, maybe I do a little collective web scraping or fiddle with some black magic from github and post it here if it gets funny.
        <br>
        
        Web site written in Django, <a href="https://github.com/FanjingLiu/Helmsman">GITHUB</a>
        


        <strong>
          In the Misc folder of this project's GITHUB, I have included a python script that might(I don't know, never tried it.) be able to scrape the information of USCIS's website, 
          <br>
          this was used for the scraping of other legal educational website for absolute educational purposes only and was never used for anything else, 
          <br>
          there's a little to none of a chance that it might work with some other websites^^(up 2 you never know)
          <br> 
          this script wasn't implemented for DDOS attack in mind, I have heard there are a lot of servers that are not protect or prepared for any DDOS attack that can be done by using 20$ per month IP proxy server exploitations.
          <br> 
          Most of all, if your information is currently held by the internet service provider that you are using, it would be really stupid to request a do anything on that server. 
          <br> 
          <H1>Please don't abuse, use at your own risk, please consult target network administrater before using the mentioned script.   </H1>
